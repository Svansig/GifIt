In the theme of an overwrought infomercial

S (as narrator)- Has this ever happened to you?

S - Thank you for exchanging messages over the world wide web with me, fellow young person.

V - I, being hip, wish to communicate with my peer, however, WOE THE DIFFICULTY OF EXPRESSING MYSELF.  If only there was an easier way!

S - I am a millenial and impatient.  Every moment my conversation partner does not respond causes me to lose confidence in their intelligence and social ability.

V - I need to send back a Graphics Interchange Format, but opening a new tab and searching takes precious time.

S - INTRODUCING GIFIT! JUST TYPE AND GET GIFS!
