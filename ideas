Chrome Extension

Sit on top of the taskbar and either:
1. Modify the page we are on
2. Make a new page (like a separate one)

// Pop up gifs based on your typed input
// Would it take an extra button press?

Dancing baby + press our button
listen for keypress - each time this will set off an event
each time an event is called, it will cancel the previous event,
which is on a setTimeout

a - send an event 'a'
b - cancels a, send b

finally resolves, then the request is sent

Pop up a gif right above the input? or below?
Have a button to change the input to the gif?
